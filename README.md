# Installation

The Online Grading System, Online Orders Processor, Media Rental Manager, and Clear Cells game are all projects that were written in Java, so they will require the user to install Eclipse and import the project.

Eclipse Installation guide: https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/installer#:~:text=5%20Steps%20to%20Install%20Eclipse%201%201.%20Download,installation%20folder%20...%205%205.%20Launch%20Eclipse%20 

The Calendar and Shell projects were developed in C, so they can be saved in a directory inside of the user's personal laptop in order to be compiled via the command line.

# Usage

All of the projects have public tests, they are in the form of a .java, .c, or .in file. Please refer to these files in order to learn the functionality of the program and to develop tests if needed.

The Shell project has a make file, therefore executing the "make" command on the command line will create an executable for the user. After creating an executable named "d8sh", also the name of the command prompt, the user will be able to input Linux and shell commands until "exit" is entered.
