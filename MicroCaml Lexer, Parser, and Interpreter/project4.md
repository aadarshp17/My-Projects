## Introduction

MicroCaml — a *dynamically-typed* version of OCaml with a subset of its features. Because MicroCaml is dynamically typed, it is not type-checked at compile time. Like other scripting languages (such as Python and Ruby), type-checking will take place when the program runs. As part of my implementation of MicroCaml, I will also implement parts of `mutop` (μtop or Microtop), a version of `utop` for MicroCaml.

### Part (A): Lexer & Parser

In the first part of my project, I will implement a lexer and parser for MicroCaml. My lexer function will convert an input string of MicroCaml into a list of tokens, and my parser function will consume these tokens to produce an abstract symbol tree (AST), either for a MicroCaml expression or for a `mutop` directive. 

Here is an example call to the lexer and parser on a MicroCaml `mutop` directive (as a string):

```ocaml
parse_mutop (tokenize "def b = let x = true in x;;")
```

This will return the AST as the following OCaml value:

```ocaml
Def ("b", Let ("x", false, (Bool true), ID "x"))
```

### Part (B): Interpreter

In the second part of this project, I will implement an interpreter to execute the ASTs produced in part (A).

In particular, I will implement two functions, `eval_expr` and `eval_mutop`. Each of these takes an `environment` (defined in [types.ml](./src/types.ml)) as a parameter, which acts as a map from variables to expressions. The `eval_expr` function evaluates an expression in the given environment, returning a `expr`, while `eval_mutop` takes a `mutop` -- a top-level directive -- and returns a possibly updated environment and any additional result.

I will need to use Imperative OCaml (notably references) in this part of the project. This use is small but important. More details below.

### Testing

All tests will be run on direct calls to my code, comparing my return values to the expected return values. Any other output (e.g., for My own debugging) will be ignored. To test from the toplevel, run `dune utop src`. The necessary functions and types will automatically be imported for you the user.

#### Running Mutop

Since I have a working parser, lexer, and evaluator implementation, you can use the interpreter by running `dune exec bin/mutop.exe`:

```ocaml
$ dune exec bin/mutop.exe
mutop # def a = 3;;                 
val a = Int 3
mutop # def b = 5;;
val b = Int 5
mutop # a * b;;
- : val: Int 15
mutop # 
```

Note that the `mutop` toplevel uses my implementations for `parse_mutop` and `eval_mutop` to execute MicroCaml expressions.

## Part A1: The Lexer (aka Scanner or Tokenizer)

My parser will take as input a list of tokens; this list is produced by the *lexer* (also called a *scanner*) as a result of processing the input string. 

Lexing is readily implemented by the use of regular expressions.

My lexer is written in [lexer.ml](./src/lexer.ml). These are the functions I have implemented:

#### `tokenize`

- **Type:** `string -> token list` 
- **Description:** Converts MicroCaml syntax (given as a string) to a corresponding token list.
- **Examples:**
  ```ocaml
  tokenize "1 + 2" = [Tok_Int 1; Tok_Add; Tok_Int 2]

  tokenize "1 (-1)" = [Tok_Int 1; Tok_Int (-1)]

  tokenize ";;" = [Tok_DoubleSemi]

  tokenize "+ - let def" = [Tok_Add; Tok_Sub; Tok_Let; Tok_Def]

  tokenize "let rec ex = fun x -> x || true;;" = 
    [Tok_Let; Tok_Rec; Tok_ID "ex"; Tok_Equal; Tok_Fun; Tok_ID "x"; Tok_Arrow; Tok_ID "x"; Tok_Or; Tok_Bool true; Tok_DoubleSemi]
  ```

The `token` type is defined in [types.ml](./src/types.ml).

Notes:
- The lexer input is case sensitive.
- Tokens can be separated by arbitrary amounts of whitespace, which My lexer should discard. Spaces, tabs ('\t') and newlines ('\n') are all considered whitespace.
- When escaping characters with `\` within Ocaml strings/regexp you must use `\\` to escape from the string and regexp.
- If the beginning of a string could match multiple tokens, the **longest** match should be preferred, for example:
  - "let0" should not be lexed as `Tok_Let` followed by `Tok_Int 0`, but as `Tok_ID("let0")`, since it is an identifier.
  - "330dlet" should be tokenized as `[Tok_Int 330; Tok_ID "dlet"]`. Arbitrary amounts of whitespace also include no whitespace.
  - "(-1)" should not be lexed as `[Tok_LParen; Tok_Sub; Tok_Int(1); Tok_LParen]` but as `Tok_Int(-1)`. (This is further explained below)

Most tokens only exist in one form (for example, the only way for `Tok_Concat` to appear in the program is as `^` and the only way for `Tok_Let` to appear in the program is as `let`). However, a few tokens have more complex rules. The regular expressions for these more complex rules are provided here:

- `Tok_Bool of bool`: The value will be set to `true` on the input string "true" and `false` on the input string "false".
  - *Regular Expression*: `true|false`
- `Tok_Int of int`: Valid ints may be positive or negative and consist of 1 or more digits. **Negative integers must be surrounded by parentheses** (without extra whitespace) to differentiate from subtraction (examples below). I may find the functions `int_of_string` and `String.sub` useful in lexing this token type.
  - *Regular Expression*: `[0-9]+` OR `(-[0-9]+)`
  - *Examples of int parenthesization*:
    - `tokenize "x -1" = [Tok_ID "x"; Tok_Sub; Tok_Int 1]`
    - `tokenize "x (-1)" = [Tok_ID "x"; Tok_Int (-1)]`
- `Tok_String of string`: Valid string will always be surrounded by `""` and **should accept any character except quotes** within them (as well as nothing). You have to "sanitize" the matched string to remove surrounding escaped quotes.
  - *Regular Expression*: `\"[^\"]*\"`
  - *Examples*:
    - `tokenize "330" = [Tok_Int 330]`
    - `tokenize "\"330\"" = [Tok_String "330"]`
    - `tokenize "\"\"\"" (* InvalidInputException *)`
- `Tok_ID of string`: Valid IDs must start with a letter and can be followed by any number of letters or numbers. **Note: Keywords may be substrings of IDs**.
  - *Regular Expression*: `[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9]*`
  - *Valid examples*:
    - "a"
    - "ABC"
    - "a1b2c3DEF6"
    - "fun1"
    - "ifthenelse"

MicroCaml syntax with its corresponding token is shown below, **excluding the four literal token types specified above**.

Token Name | Lexical Representation
--- | ---
`Tok_LParen` | `(`
`Tok_RParen` | `)`
`Tok_LCurly` | `{`
`Tok_RCurly` | `}`
`Tok_Dot` | `.`
`Tok_Equal` | `=`
`Tok_NotEqual` | `<>`
`Tok_Greater` | `>`
`Tok_Less` | `<`
`Tok_GreaterEqual` | `>=`
`Tok_LessEqual` | `<=`
`Tok_Or` | `\|\|`
`Tok_And` | `&&`
`Tok_Not` | `not`
`Tok_If` | `if`
`Tok_Then` | `then`
`Tok_Else` | `else`
`Tok_Add` | `+`
`Tok_Sub` | `-`
`Tok_Mult` | `*`
`Tok_Div` | `/`
`Tok_Concat` | `^`
`Tok_Let` | `let`
`Tok_Def` | `def`
`Tok_In` | `in`
`Tok_Rec` | `rec`
`Tok_Fun` | `fun`
`Tok_Arrow` | `->`
`Tok_DoubleSemi` | `;;`
`Tok_Semi` | `;`

Notes:
- My lexing code will feed the tokens into my parser, so a broken lexer can cause me to fail tests related to parsing. 
- In the grammar given below, the syntax matching tokens (lexical representation) is used instead of the token name. For example, the grammar below will use `(` instead of `Tok_LParen`. 

## Part A2: Parsing MicroCaml Expressions

In this part, I will implement `parse_expr`, which takes a stream of tokens and outputs as AST for the input expression of type `expr`. Put all of My parser code in [parser.ml](./src/parser.ml) in accordance with the signature found in [parser.mli](./src/parser.mli). 

We present a quick overview of `parse_expr` first, then the definition of AST types it should return, and finally the grammar it should parse.

### `parse_expr`
- **Type:** `token list -> token list * expr`
- **Description:** Takes a list of tokens and returns an AST representing the MicroCaml expression corresponding to the given tokens, along with any tokens left in the token list.
- **Exceptions:** Raise `InvalidInputException` if the input fails to parse i.e does not match the MicroCaml expression grammar.
- **Examples** (more below):
  ```ocaml
  parse_expr [Tok_Int(1); Tok_Add; Tok_Int(2)] =  ([], Binop (Add, (Int 1), (Int 2)))

  parse_expr [Tok_Int(1)] = ([], (Int 1))

  parse_expr [Tok_Let; Tok_ID("x"); Tok_Equal; Tok_Bool(true); Tok_In; Tok_ID("x")] = 
  ([], Let ("x", false, (Bool true), ID "x"))

  parse_expr [Tok_DoubleSemi] (* raises InvalidInputException *)
  ```

I will likely want to implement My parser using the the `lookahead` and `match_tok` functions that we have provided; more about them is at the end of this README.

### AST and Grammar for `parse_expr`

Below is the AST type `expr`, which is returned by `parse_expr`. **Note** that the `environment` and `Closure of environment * var * expr` parts are only relevant to Part (B), so I can ignore them for now.

```ocaml
type op = Add | Sub | Mult | Div | Concat | Greater | Less | GreaterEqual | LessEqual | Equal | NotEqual | Or | And

type var = string

type label = Lab of var

type expr =
  | Int of int
  | Bool of bool
  | String of string
  | Closure of environment * var * expr (* not used in P4A *)
  | ID of var
  | Fun of var * expr (* an anonymous function: var is the parameter and expr is the body *)
  | Not of expr
  | Binop of op * expr * expr
  | If of expr * expr * expr
  | App of expr * expr
  | Let of var * bool * expr * expr (* bool determines whether var is recursive *)
  | Record of (label * expr) list
  | Select of  label * expr 
and environment = (var * expr ref) list 
```

The CFG below describes the language of MicroCaml expressions. This CFG is right-recursive, so something like `1 + 2 + 3` will parse as `Add (Int 1, Add (Int 2, Int 3))`, essentially implying parentheses in the form `(1 + (2 + 3))`.) In the given CFG note that all non-terminals are capitalized, all syntax literals (terminals) are formatted `as non-italicized code` and will come in to the parser as tokens from My lexer. Variant token types (i.e. `Tok_Bool`, `Tok_Int`, `Tok_String` and `Tok_ID`) will be printed *`as italicized code`*.

- Expr -> LetExpr | IfExpr | FunctionExpr | OrExpr
- LetExpr -> `let` Recursion *`Tok_ID`* `=` Expr `in` Expr
  -	Recursion -> `rec` | ε
- FunctionExpr -> `fun` *`Tok_ID`* `->` Expr
- IfExpr -> `if` Expr `then` Expr `else` Expr
- OrExpr -> AndExpr `||` OrExpr | AndExpr
- AndExpr -> EqualityExpr `&&` AndExpr | EqualityExpr
- EqualityExpr -> RelationalExpr EqualityOperator EqualityExpr | RelationalExpr
  - EqualityOperator -> `=` | `<>`
- RelationalExpr -> AdditiveExpr RelationalOperator RelationalExpr | AdditiveExpr
  - RelationalOperator -> `<` | `>` | `<=` | `>=`
- AdditiveExpr -> MultiplicativeExpr AdditiveOperator AdditiveExpr | MultiplicativeExpr
  - AdditiveOperator -> `+` | `-`
- MultiplicativeExpr -> ConcatExpr MultiplicativeOperator MultiplicativeExpr | ConcatExpr
  - MultiplicativeOperator -> `*` | `/`
- ConcatExpr -> UnaryExpr `^` ConcatExpr | UnaryExpr
- UnaryExpr -> `not` UnaryExpr | AppExpr
- AppExpr -> SelectExpr PrimaryExpr | SelectExpr
- SelectExpr -> PrimaryExpr `.` *`Tok_ID`* | PrimaryExpr
- PrimaryExpr -> *`Tok_Int`* | *`Tok_Bool`* | *`Tok_String`* | *`Tok_ID`* | `(` Expr `)`| RecordExpr 
- RecordExpr -> `{` RecordBodyExpr `}` | `{` `}`
- RecordBodyExpr -> *`Tok_ID`* `=` Expr `;` RecordBodyExpr | *`Tok_ID`* `=` Expr


To illustrate `parse_expr` in action, we show several examples of input and their output AST.

### Example 1: Basic math

**Input:**
```ocaml
(1 + 2 + 3) / 3
```

**Output (after lexing and parsing):**
```ocaml
Binop (Div,
  Binop (Add, (Int 1), Binop (Add, (Int 2), (Int 3))),
  (Int 3))
```

In other words, if we run `parse_expr (tokenize "(1 + 2 + 3) / 3")` it will return the AST above.

### Example 2: Records
**Input:**
```ocaml
{}
```
**Output (after lexing and parsing):**
```ocaml
Record []
```

**Input:**
```ocaml
{x=10; y=20}
```
**Output (after lexing and parsing):**
```ocaml
Record [(Lab "x", Int 10); (Lab "y", Int 20)]
```

**Input:**
```ocaml
{x=10; y=20}.x
```
**Output (after lexing and parsing):**
```ocaml
Select (Lab "x", Record [(Lab "x", Int 10); (Lab "y", Int 20)])
```
**Input:**
```ocaml
e.type
```
**Output (after lexing and parsing):**
```ocaml
Select (Lab "type", ID "e")
```

### Example 3: `let` expressions

**Input:**
```ocaml
let x = 2 * 3 / 5 + 4 in x - 5
```

**Output (after lexing and parsing):**
```ocaml
Let ("x", false,
  Binop (Add,
    Binop (Mult, (Int 2), Binop (Div, (Int 3), (Int 5))),
    (Int 4)),
  Binop (Sub, ID "x", (Int 5)))
```

### Example 4: `if then ... else ...`

**Input:**
```ocaml
let x = 3 in if not true then x > 3 else x < 3
```

**Output (after lexing and parsing):**
```ocaml
Let ("x", false, (Int 3),
  If (Not ((Bool true)), Binop (Greater, ID "x", (Int 3)),
   Binop (Less, ID "x", (Int 3))))
```

### Example 5: Anonymous functions

**Input:**
```ocaml
let rec f = fun x -> x ^ 1 in f 1
```

**Output (after lexing and parsing):**
```ocaml
Let ("f", true, Fun ("x", Binop (Concat, ID "x", (Int 1))),
  App (ID "f", (Int 1)))
```

Keep in mind that the parser is not responsible for finding type errors. This is the job of the interpreter in Part (B). For example, while the AST for `1 1` should be parsed as `App ((Int 1), (Int 1))`; if it is executed by the interpreter, it will at that time be flagged as a type error.

### Example 5: Recursive anonymous functions

Notice how the AST for `let` expressions uses a `bool` flag to determine whether a function is recursive or not. When a recursive anonymous function `let rec f = fun x -> ... in ...` is defined, `f` will bind to `fun x -> ...` when evaluating the function. The interpreter will be responsible for handling this, as well as cases where `rec` is used without anonymous functions and attempted recursion without using `rec`.

For now, let's create an infinite recursive loop for fun:

**Input:**
```ocaml
let rec f = fun x -> f (x*x) in f 2
```

**Output (after lexing and parsing):**
```ocaml
Let ("f", true,
  Fun ("x", App (ID "f", Binop (Mult, ID "x", ID "x"))),
  App (ID "f", (Int 2))))
```

### Example 6: Currying

We will **ONLY** be currying to create multivariable functions as well as passing multiple arguments to them. Here is an example:

**Input:**
```ocaml
let f = fun x -> fun y -> x + y in (f 1) 2
```

**Output (after lexing and parsing):**
```ocaml
Let ("f", false, 
  Fun ("x", Fun ("y", Binop (Add, ID "x", ID "y"))),
  App (App (ID "f", (Int 1)), (Int 2)))
```

## Part A3: Parsing `mutop` directives

In this part, I will implement `parse_mutop` (putting My code in [parser.ml](./src/parser.ml)) in accordance with the signature found in [parser.mli](./src/parser.mli). This function takes a token list produced by lexing a string that is a mutop (top-level) MicroCaml directive, and returns an AST of OCaml type `mutop`. My implementation of `parse_mutop` will reuse My `parse_expr` implementation, and will not be much extra work.

We present a quick overview of the function first, then the definition of AST types it should return, and finally the grammar it should parse.

#### `parse_mutop`
- **Type:** `token list -> token list * mutop`
- **Description:** Takes a list of tokens and returns an AST representing the MicroCaml expression at the `mutop` level corresponding to the given tokens, along with any tokens left in the token list.
- **Exceptions:** Raise `InvalidInputException` if the input fails to parse i.e does not match the MicroCaml definition grammar.
- **Examples:**
  ```ocaml
  parse_mutop [Tok_Def; Tok_ID("x"); Tok_Equal; Tok_Bool(true); Tok_DoubleSemi] = ([], Def ("x", (Bool true)))

  parse_mutop [Tok_DoubleSemi] = ([], NoOp)

  parse_mutop [Tok_Int(1); Tok_DoubleSemi] = ([], Expr ((Int 1))))

  parse_mutop [Tok_Let; Tok_ID "x"; Tok_Equal; Tok_Bool true; Tok_In; Tok_ID "x"; Tok_DoubleSemi] = 
  ([], Expr (Let ("x", false, (Bool true), ID "x")))
  ```

### AST and Grammar of `parse_mutop`

Below is the AST type `mutop`, which is returned by `parse_mutop`, followed by the CFG that it parses for MicroCaml expressions at the `mutop` level. This CFG is similar (and similarly formatted) to the CFG of `parse_expr` and relies its implementation of Expr.

```ocaml
type mutop = 
  | Def of var * expr
  | Expr of expr
  | NoOp
```

The CFG is as follows:

- Mutop -> DefMutop | ExprMutop | `;;`
- DefMutop -> `def` *`Tok_ID`* `=` Expr `;;`
- ExprMutop -> Expr `;;`

Notice how a valid input for the `parse_mutop` must always terminate with `Tok_DoubleSemi` and input of just `Tok_DoubleSemi` to the parser is considered valid as per the AST.

For this part, we created a new keyword `def` to refer to top-level MicroCaml expressions to differentiate local `let`. In essence, `def` is similar to top-level (global) `let` expressions in normal (OCaml) `utop`. This means `def` will create **global definitions** for variables while running `mutop`. Another key difference between `def` and the `let` expressions defined in Part A2 is that `def` should be *implicitly recursive*. (Note that `def rec x = ...;;` is not valid as per the given AST---basically the `rec` is implicit).

Here are some example mutop directives. Note that `parse_mutop` should return a tuple of (updated token list, parsed AST), but in these examples we omit the updated token list since it should always just be an empty list.

### Example 1: Global definition 

**Input:**
```ocaml
def x = let a = 3 in if a <> 3 then 0 else 1;;
```

**Output (after lexing and parsing):**
```ocaml
Def ("x",
  Let ("a", false, (Int 3),
    If (Binop (NotEqual, ID "a", (Int 3)), (Int 0), (Int 1))))
```

### Example 2: Implicit recursion on `f`

**Input:**
```ocaml
def f = fun x -> if x > 0 then f (x-1) else "done";;
```

**Output (after lexing and parsing):**
```ocaml
Def ("f",
  Fun ("x",
   If (Binop (Greater, ID "x", (Int 0)),
    App (ID "f", Binop (Sub, ID "x", (Int 1))),
    (String "done"))))
```

### Example 3: Expression

**Input:**
```ocaml
(fun x -> "(" ^ x ^ ")") "parenthesis";;
```

**Output (after lexing and parsing):**
```ocaml
Expr (
  App (Fun ("x",
    Binop (Concat, (String "("),
      Binop (Concat, ID "x", (String ")")))),
    (String "parenthesis")))
```

## Provided functions

To help I implement both parsers, we have provided some helper functions in the `parser.ml` file. I are not required to use these, but they are recommended.

### `match_token`
- **Type:** `token list -> token -> token list`
- **Description:** Takes the list of tokens and a single token as arguments, and returns a new token list with the first token removed IF the first token matches the second argument.
- **Exceptions:** Raise `InvalidInputException` if the first token does not match the second argument to the function.

### `match_many`
- **Type:** `token list -> token list -> token list`
- **Description:** An extension of `match_token` that matches a sequence of tokens given as the second token list and returns a new token list with that matches each token in the order in which they appear in the sequence. For example, `match_many toks [Tok_Let]` is equivalent to `match_token toks Tok_Let`.
- **Exceptions:** Raise `InvalidInputException` if the tokens do not match.

### `lookahead`
- **Type:** `token list -> token option`
- **Description:** Returns the top token in the list of tokens as an option, returning `None` if the token list is empty. **In constructing My parser, the lack of lookahead token (None) is fine for the epsilon case.**

### `lookahead_many`
- **Type:** `token list -> int -> token option`
- **Description:** An extension of `lookahead` that returns token at the nth index in the list of tokens as an option, returning `None` if the token list is empty at the given index or the index is negative. For example, `lookahead_many toks 0` is equivalent to `lookahead toks`.

## Part (B): MicroCaml Interpreter

In part (B), I will write an interpreter for MicroCaml by implementing two functions: `eval_expr` and `eval_mutop`.

I will need to use a bit of Imperative OCaml -- notably references -- to implement this part of the project. This use is small, but important. More details below.

## Part B1: Evaluating Expressions

#### `eval_expr`
- **Type:** `environment -> expr -> expr`
- **Description:** This function takes in an environment `env` and an expression `e`, and returns the result of `e` evaluated within the environment `env`, which just so happens to be another expression. The returned expression can be thought of as a "reduction" of the input expression `e`.

The environment `env` is a `(var * expr ref) list`, where `var` refers to an variable name (a string), and the `expr ref` refers to its corresponding expression in the `environment`; it's a `ref` because the expression could change, due to implementing recursion, as discussed for `Let` below. Elements earlier in the list shadow elements later in the list. 

### Exceptions

Here's a list of all the possible error cases and exceptions (can also be found in `types.ml`):

```ocaml
exception TypeError of string
exception DeclareError of string
exception SelectError of string
exception DivByZeroError
```

- A `TypeError` happens when an operation receives an argument of the wrong type
- A `DeclareError` happens when an ID is seen that has not been declared
- A `SelectError` happens when trying to select a nonexistent label from a record
- A `DivByZeroError` happens on attempted division by zero

Note that we do not enforce what messages I use when raising `TypeError`, `DeclareError`, or `SelectError` exceptions. That's up to I.

### Evaluation

Evaluation of subexpressions should be done from left to right to ensure that lines with multiple possible errors match up with our expected errors.

Now we describe what My interpreter should do for each kind of `expr`:

```ocaml
type expr =
  | Int of int
  | Bool of bool
  | String of string
  | ID of var
  | Fun of var * expr
  | Not of expr
  | Binop of op * expr * expr
  | If of expr * expr * expr
  | App of expr * expr
  | Let of var * bool * expr * expr
  | Closure of environment * var * expr
  | Record of (label * expr) list
  | Select of label * expr
```

### ID

An identifier evaluates to whatever expression it is mapped to by the environment. Should raise a `DeclareError` if the identifier has no binding.

```ocaml
eval_expr [("x", ref (Int 1))] (ID "x") = Int 1
eval_expr [] (ID "x") (* DeclareError "Unbound variable x" *)
```

See the discussion of `Let` below for advice about managing environments.

### Not

The unary `not` operator operates only on booleans and produces a `Bool` containing the negated boolean value of the contained expression. If the expression in the `Not` is not a boolean (or does not evaluate to a boolean), a `TypeError` should be raised.

```ocaml
eval_expr [("x", ref (Bool true))] (Not (ID "x")) = Bool false
eval_expr [("x", ref (Bool true))] (Not (Not (ID "x"))) = Bool true
eval_expr [] (Not (Int 1)) (* TypeError "Expected type bool" *)
```

### Binop

There are five sorts of binary operator: Those carrying out integer arithmetic; those carrying out integer ordering comparisons; one carrying out string concatenation; and one carrying out equality (and inequality) comparisons; and those implementing boolean logic.

#### Add, Sub, Mult, and Div

Arithmetic operators work on integers; if either argument evaluates to a non-`Int`, a `TypeError` should be raised. An attempt to divide by zero should raise a `DivByZeroError` exceptio. 

```ocaml
eval_expr [] (Binop (Add, (Int 1), (Int 2))) = Int 3
eval_expr [] (Binop (Add, (Int 1), (Bool false))) (* TypeError "Expected type int" *)
eval_expr [] (Binop (Div, (Int 1), (Int 0))) (* DivByZeroError *)
```

#### Greater, Less, GreaterEqual, and LessEqual

These relational operators operate only on integers and produce a `Bool` containing the result of the operation. If either argument evaluates to a non-`Int`, a `TypeError` should be raised.

```ocaml
eval_expr [] (Binop(Greater, (Int 1), (Int 2))) = Bool false
eval_expr [] (Binop(LessEqual, (Bool false), (Bool true))) (* TypeError "Expected type int" *)
```

#### Concat

This operation returns the result of concatenating two strings; if either argument evaluates to a non-`String`, a `TypeError` should be raised. 

```ocaml
eval_expr [] (Binop (Concat, (Int 1), (Int 2))) (* TypeError "Expected type string" *)
eval_expr [] (Binop (Concat, (String "hello "), (String "ocaml"))) = String "hello ocaml"
```

#### Equal and NotEqual

The equality operators require both arguments to be of the same type. The operators produce a `Bool` containing the result of the operation. If the two arguments to these operators do not evaluate to the same type (e.g., one boolean and one integer), a `TypeError` should be raised. Moreover, we *cannot compare two closures for equality* -- to do so risks an infinite loop because of the way recursive functions are implemented; trying to compare them also raises `TypeError` (OCaml does the same thing in its implementation, BTW).

```ocaml
eval_expr [] (Binop(NotEqual, (Int 1), (Int 2))) = Bool true
eval_expr [] (Binop(Equal, (Bool false), (Bool true))) = Bool false
eval_expr [] (Binop(Equal, (String "hi"), (String "hi"))) = Bool true
eval_expr [] (Binop(NotEqual, (Int 1), (Bool false))) (* TypeError "Cannot compare types" *)
```

#### Or and And

These logical operations operate only on booleans and produce a `Bool` result. If either argument evaluates to a non-`Bool`, a `TypeError` should be raised.

```ocaml
eval_expr [] (Binop(Or, (Int 1), (Int 2))) (* TypeError "Expected type bool" *)
eval_expr [] (Binop(Or, (Bool false), (Bool true))) = Bool true
```

### If

The `If` expression consists of three subexpressions - a guard, the true branch, and the false branch. The guard expression must evaluate to a `Bool` - if it does not, a `TypeError` should be raised. If it evaluates to `Bool true`, the true branch should be evaluated; else the false branch should be. 

```ocaml
eval_expr [] (If (Binop (Equal, (Int 3), (Int 3)), (Bool true), (Bool false))) = Bool true
eval_expr [] (If (Binop (Equal, (Int 3), (Int 2)), (Int 5), (Bool false))) = Bool false
```

Notes:
- Only one branch should be evaluated, not both. 
- The true and false branches **could evaluate to expressions having different types**. This is an effect of MicroCaml being dynamically typed.

### Let

The `Let` consists of four components - an ID's name `var` (which is a string); a boolean indicating whether or not the bound variable is referenced in its own definition (i.e., whether it's *recursive*); the *initialization expression*; and the *body expression*.

#### Non-recursive bindings

For a non-recursive `Let`, we first evaluate the initialization expression, which produces an expression *ex* or raises an error. If the former, we then return the result of evaluating the body expression in an environment extended with a mapping from the `Let`'s ID variable to *ex*. (Evaluating the body might cause an exception to be raised.) 

```ocaml
eval_expr [] (Let ("x", false,
  Binop (Add, Binop (Mult, (Int 2), 
    Binop (Div, (Int 3), (Int 5))), (Int 4)),
  Binop (Sub, ID "x", (Int 5)))) = Int (-1)
```

#### Recursive bindings

For a recursive `Let`, we evaluate the initialization expression in an environment extended with a mapping from the ID we are binding to a temporary placeholder; this way, the initialization expression is permitted to refer to itself, the ID being bound. Then, we *update* that placeholder to *v*, the result, before evaluating the body.

The AST given in this example corresponds to the MicroCaml program `let rec f = fun x -> if x = 0 then x else (x + (f (x-1))) in f 8`:

```ocaml
eval_expr [] (Let ("f", true,
  Fun ("x",
    If (Binop (Equal, ID "x", (Int 0)), ID "x",
      Binop (Add, ID "x",
        App (ID "f", Binop (Sub, ID "x", (Int 1)))))),
    App (ID "f", (Int 8)))) = Int 36
```

#### Environments

Being able to modify the placeholder is made possibly by using references; this is why the type `environment` given in `types.ml` is `(var * expr ref) list` and not `(var * expr) list`. To make it easy to work with this kind of environment, we recommend I use the functions given at the top of `eval.ml`:

- `extend env x e` produces an environment that extends `env` with a mapping from `x` to `e`
- `lookup env x` returns `e` if `x` maps to `e` in `env`; if there are multiple mappings, it chooses the most recent.
- `extend_tmp x` produces an environment that extends `env` with a mapping from `x` to a temporary placeholder.
- `update env x e` produces an environment that updates `env` in place, modifying its most recent mapping for `x` to be `e` instead (removing the placeholder).

### Fun

The `Fun` is used for anonymous functions, which consist of two components - a parameter, which is a string as an ID's name, and a body, which is an expression. A `Fun` evaluates to a `Closure` that captures the current environment, so as to implement lexical (aka static) scoping.

```ocaml
eval_expr [("x", ref (Bool true))] (Fun ("y", Binop (And, ID "x", ID "y")))
  = Closure ([("x", ref (Bool true))], "y", Binop (And, ID "x", ID "y"))
eval_expr [] (Fun ("x", Fun ("y", Binop (And, ID "x", ID "y"))))
	= Closure ([], "x", Fun ("y", Binop (And, ID "x", ID "y")))
```

### App

`App` has two subexpressions. We evaluate the first to a `Closure(A,x,e)` (otherwise, a `TypeError` should be raised) and the second to a expression *v*. Then we evaluate `e` (the closure's body) in environment `A` (the closure's environment), returning the result.

```ocaml
eval_expr [] (App ((Int 1), (Int 1))) (* TypeError "Not a function" *)
eval_expr [] (Let ("f", false, Fun ("x", Fun ("y", Binop (Add, ID "x", ID "y"))),
  App (App (ID "f", (Int 1)), (Int 2)))) = Int 3
```

The AST in the second example is equivalent to the MicroCaml expression `let f = fun x -> fun y -> x + y in (f 1) 2`.

### Record and Select

A `Record` consists of a list of fields, or more specifically a list of `(label * expr)` tuples:

```ocaml
eval_expr [] (Record [(Lab "x", Int 10); (Lab "y", Int 20)])
  = Record [(Lab "x", Int 10); (Lab "y", Int 20)]
```

A `Select` consists of a `label` and an `expr`. We first evaluate the `expr` to a `Record` type (otherwise a `TypeError` should be raised). Then we try to look up the corresponding `label` within the `Record`. If the `label` exists, we return the evaluated `expr` that it's tied to. Otherwise, we raise a `SelectError`.

```ocaml
eval_expr [] (Select (Lab "x", (Record [(Lab "x", Int 10); (Lab "y", Int 20)])))
  = Int 10
eval_expr [] (Select (Lab "x", (Bool false)))
  (* TypeError "Not a record" *)
eval_expr [] (Select (Lab "z", (Record [(Lab "x", Int 10); (Lab "y", Int 20)]))) 
  (* SelectError "Label not found" *)
```

## Part B2: Evaluating Mutop Directive

#### `eval_mutop`
- **Type:** `environment -> mutop -> environment * (expr option)`
- **Description:** This function evaluates the given `mutop` directive in the given `environment`, returning an updated environment with an optional `expr` as the result.

There are three kinds of `mutop` directive (as defined in [types.ml](./src/types.ml)):

  ```ocaml
  type mutop =
    | Def of var * expr
    | Expr of expr
    | NoOp
  ```

### Def

For a `Def`, we evaluate its `expr` in the given environment, but with a placeholder set for `var` (see the discussion of recursive `Let`, above, for more about environment placeholders), producing expression *ex*. We then update the binding for `var` to be *ex* and return the extended environment, along with the expression itself. 

```ocaml
eval_mutop [] (Def ("x", (Bool(true)))) =  ([("x", {contents = Bool true})], Some (Bool true))
```
```ocaml
eval_mutop [] (Def ("f",
  Fun ("y",
    If (Binop (Equal, ID "y", (Int 0)), (Int 1),
    App (ID "f", Binop (Sub, ID "y", (Int 1))))))) =
([("f",
  {contents =
    Closure (<cycle>, "y",
      If (Binop (Equal, ID "y", (Int 0)), (Int 1),
        App (ID "f", Binop (Sub, ID "y", (Int 1)))))})],
  Some 
    (Closure ([("f", {contents = <cycle>})], "y",
      If (Binop (Equal, ID "y", (Int 0)), (Int 1),
        App (ID "f", Binop (Sub, ID "y", (Int 1)))))))
```

### Expr
For a `Expr`, we should evaluate the expression in the given environment, and return that environment and the resulting expression.

```ocaml
eval_mutop [] (Expr (App (Fun ("x",
  Binop (Concat, (String "("),
    Binop (Concat, ID "x", (String ")")))),
      (String "parenthesis")))) = ([], Some (String "(parenthesis)"))
```

### NoOp

The `NoOp` should return the original environment and no expression (`None`).

```ocaml
eval_mutop [] NoOp = ([], None)
```
